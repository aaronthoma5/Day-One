## About Day-One

Day-One is an iOS application designed to encourage consistency and long-term growth for multidisciplinary artists by helping them track their creative progress over time. The app allows the user to add and organize their artwork, personalize each piece with descriptions or notes, and build a meaningful record of their creative journey. By presenting artwork in a clean, easily accessible collection, Day-One makes it simple for artists to reflect on their development and stay motivated. In addition, the app visually tracks creative streaks and days spent creating, reinforcing healthy habits and accountability while supporting sustained artistic practice.

# Development Journey

This repository documents the collaborative one month long process of building the development of Day-One. As a team of four developers with iOS development experience with the Detroit Apple Developer Academy, teamwork guided our process from start to finish. As a well-rounded group, we leveraged our strengths in design, coding, and project management to develop Day-One as a user-centered product grounded in real needs. James, a Renaissance developer at the Academy, served as the foundation of our app's vision. Through extensive interviews and research into his artistic workflow, we committed to creating a solution that aligns with his goals while removing barriers that could limit his creativity.
