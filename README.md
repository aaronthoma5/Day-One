The app allows the user to add and organize their artwork, personalize each piece with descriptions or notes, and build a meaningful record of their creative journey.

# Development Journey

This repository documents the collaborative one month long process of building the development of Day-One. As a team of four developers with iOS development experience with the Detroit Apple Developer Academy, teamwork guided our process from start to finish. As a well-rounded group, we leveraged our strengths in design, coding, and project management to develop Day-One as a user-centered product grounded in real needs. James, a Renaissance developer at the Academy, served as the foundation of our app's vision. Through extensive interviews and research into his artistic workflow, we committed to creating a solution that aligns with his goals while removing barriers that could limit his creativity.
